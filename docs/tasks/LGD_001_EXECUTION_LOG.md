## FND-001 — Scaffold the reproducible Django and dependency baseline

- **Completion date:** 2026-09-01
- **Outcome:** Added a reproducible Python 3.13.15 / Django 5.2.17 monolith scaffold,
  hash-locked Python environments, an npm lock, five acyclic application namespaces, PostgreSQL URL
  parsing, Django entry points, and a non-disclosing placeholder response.
- **Important files changed:** `manage.py`, `config/`, `apps/`, `requirements/`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.python-version`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`,
  bootstrap smoke tests, and the Tailwind input.
- **Migrations created:** None. Django's 18 built-in `admin`, `auth`, `contenttypes`, and `sessions`
  migrations applied successfully to the ignored development database.
- **Focused tests executed:** Bootstrap, dependency-version, Django entry-point/URL/command, and
  PostgreSQL profile tests: 12 passed plus 2 parameter subtests.
- **Broader checks executed:** `npm ci` (0 vulnerabilities), `npm run css:build`, `python manage.py
  check`, `python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run`, `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check
  .`, and `mypy apps config` passed.
- **Manual or visual verification:** Django 5.2.17 development server started on Python 3.13.15;
  an HTTP request to `/` returned `200`, `text/plain; charset=utf-8`, and exactly `OK`.
- **Security or privacy review:** Only fake development placeholders are present; runtime private,
  environment, database, compiled-static, and dependency directories are ignored. No public media
  or admin route, CDN, domain model, cross-app import, personal data, debug output, or test
  suppression was introduced.
- **Approved deviations:** None.
- **Remaining blockers:** None.

## FND-002 — Establish settings, locale, storage, and HTTP baselines

- **Completion date:** 2026-09-01
- **Outcome:** Split base/development/test/production settings; made production inputs fail closed;
  configured Vietnamese-only locale, UTC-aware storage and Ho Chi Minh presentation; added
  non-public private storage and overlap checks; and delivered generic liveness/readiness endpoints.
- **Important files changed:** `config/settings/`, `config/environment.py`, `config/urls.py`, Django
  entry points, `apps/core/{storage,checks,views}.py`, `locale/`, `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`,
  `README.md`, and focused core tests.
- **Migrations created:** None. Migration drift check reported no changes.
- **Focused tests executed:** Settings, environment validation, locale/time-zone, private storage,
  deployment check, and health tests: 15 passed.
- **Broader checks executed:** Full pytest/branch-coverage gate: 27 passed and 100% current `apps`
  branch coverage. `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `mypy apps config`, `python manage.py
  check`, migration drift, `npm run css:build`, `makemessages`, `compilemessages`, and production
  `collectstatic` passed. Production `check --deploy` exited successfully with only `security.W004`;
  the check remains enabled and HSTS is intentionally deferred until the HTTPS validation required
  by `SEC-002`.
- **Manual or visual verification:** Development server returned generic `200 OK` responses for
  `/`, `/health/live/`, and `/health/ready/` with `Content-Language: vi` and `Cache-Control:
  no-store`. A synthetic UTC instant displayed as `2026-01-01T07:00:00+07:00` under the Vietnamese
  runtime. There is no user interface at this checkpoint requiring responsive visual inspection.
- **Security or privacy review:** Production rejects absent values and wildcard hosts/origins;
  private and static paths must not overlap; stored private files/directories were verified as
  `0600`/`0700`; URL generation and direct private/media routes are denied; readiness failures
  return no exception or database detail. No personal data, credentials, sensitive logging, public
  media route, test suppression, or business model was introduced.
- **Approved deviations:** None.
- **Remaining blockers:** None. Production HSTS rollout remains assigned to `SEC-002` after HTTPS
  validation, as required by the locked specification.

## FND-003 — Build the test, coverage, and CI quality gate

- **Completion date:** 2026-09-01
- **Outcome:** Added a blocking GitHub Actions quality job with restricted permissions, full-SHA
  action pins, Python 3.13, Node.js 22, PostgreSQL 17, locked installs, migration-from-zero,
  branch-coverage, Python/Django, CSS, i18n, static/deploy, and Playwright gates. Added PostgreSQL
  test settings, synthetic non-privileged factories, a CSRF-enforcing client, and an automatically
  armed 95% sensitive-module branch gate on top of the 85% overall threshold.
- **Important files changed:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `config/settings/test.py`,
  `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/factories.py`, PostgreSQL/quality/coverage tests,
  `scripts/check_sensitive_coverage.py`, `playwright.config.js`, browser smoke, locks, and `README.md`.
- **Dependencies and locks changed:** Added exact `factory-boy==3.3.3` (and locked Faker 40.37.0)
  and `@playwright/test` 1.62.1. Python hashes and npm integrity metadata are committed; npm audit
  reported zero vulnerabilities.
- **Tests and commands executed:** The task run passed 38 PostgreSQL-backed tests at 100% current
  `apps` branch coverage, sensitive coverage activation, Ruff lint/format, mypy, Django checks,
  migration drift, Tailwind, message extraction/compilation, deploy checks, static collection, CI
  YAML parsing, and the Playwright health smoke. The final checkpoint run passed 44 tests.
- **Migration verification:** A disposable PostgreSQL 18.6 database applied all 18 built-in Django
  migrations from zero; the PostgreSQL integration test ran without a skip and drift remained empty.
- **Security/privacy review:** CI has `contents: read`, checkout credentials are not persisted,
  untrusted pull requests do not receive secrets, no allow-failure/advisory gate or retained artifact
  exists, and only synthetic `example.invalid` identities and environment values are used.
- **CI status:** Workflow syntax, ordering, service configuration, and every equivalent gate passed
  locally. No remote GitHub Actions run was observable, so the remote result remains **pending**.
- **Commit:** `150ecac` (`build(quality): establish blocking CI gate`).
- **Remaining blockers:** Remote CI observation only; no implementation blocker.

## FND-004 — Implement local frontend assets and design-system primitives

- **Completion date:** 2026-09-01
- **Outcome:** Delivered the Tailwind 4 CLI foundation, 4px semantic tokens, light/dark/system themes,
  accessible buttons/forms/alerts/badges/table/dialog/status states, a no-JavaScript baseline, and a
  Vietnamese component gallery at `/foundation/components/` without Vite or an application shell.
- **Important files changed:** `static_src/{css,js}/`, generated first-party `static/js/app.js`,
  checksummed `static/vendor/`, deterministic vendor script, `templates/base.html`,
  `templates/components/`, gallery template/view/URL, frontend/browser tests, CI, npm lock, and docs.
- **Dependencies and locks changed:** Replaced standard Alpine 3.16.3 with exact CSP-friendly
  `@alpinejs/csp` 3.17.1; retained exact HTMX 2.0.10 and Tailwind 4.3.3. The manifest records source,
  SPDX license, version, destination, and SHA-256 for both vendored runtime files.
- **Tests and commands executed:** Six frontend foundation tests, 11 Playwright tests, `npm ci`,
  `npm run assets:verify`, `npm run css:build`, Tailwind watch startup, full Python coverage and
  quality commands, Django/i18n/static/deploy commands, development server startup, and secret/CDN
  scans passed.
- **Browser and accessibility checks:** Pinned Chromium passed compact 375px, tablet 768px, and wide
  1440px reflow; keyboard skip-link and dialog focus containment/Escape/restore; visible focus;
  200% zoom; light/dark/system; reduced motion; forced colors; strict no-eval CSP; and JavaScript-off
  rendering. Temporary compact-light, tablet-dark, and wide-light screenshots were manually
  inspected and were not retained in the repository. Chrome DevTools MCP was unavailable, so the
  configured real Playwright browser was used instead.
- **Security/privacy review:** No CDN, Vite, SPA, client router, public media route, runtime eval,
  sensitive persistence, or client authority was added. HTMX history is disabled and its path key
  cleared; only the non-sensitive `vds-theme` preference may persist. No case/legal/personal data,
  domain models, workflows, screenshots, or debug artifacts are present.
- **Commit:** `2413bc5` (`feat(frontend): add accessible local design primitives`).
- **Remaining blockers:** None.

## CP-FND-B — Checkpoint closure

- **Completion date:** 2026-09-01
- **Outcome:** Local CP-FND-B gates passed and `FND-003`/`FND-004` are complete. `FND-001` and
  `FND-002` remained unchanged after regression verification.
- **Checkpoint evidence:** A newly empty PostgreSQL database applied migrations from zero; locked
  Python/npm installs, asset hashes, CSS, i18n, 44 tests with 100% branch coverage, sensitive gate,
  Ruff, mypy, Django system/drift/deploy checks, static collection, runserver/watch startup, CI YAML,
  11 browser tests, and security/privacy scans passed. Deploy check retained only the expected HSTS
  warning assigned to `SEC-002`.
- **CI status:** All local equivalents passed; remote GitHub Actions result is **pending** and the
  corresponding Milestone 1 checkbox remains open rather than being reported as passed.
- **Commits:** `150ecac` (FND-003) and `2413bc5` (FND-004).
- **Unresolved blockers:** Remote CI observation only. The next eligible task is `IAM-001`; it was
  not started.
